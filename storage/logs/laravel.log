      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is dedicated to providing quality data to our clients. To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

We deliver high-quality market research data to clients who are in various business industries, including other market research agencies.

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

REWARDS are redeemable for cash, vouchers and other prizes.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">Earning REWARDS REWARDS will be credited to your account only through your participation in activities authorised by The Brand Surgeon, which include, but are not limited to, registration as a panellist, completion of demographic profiles and completion of qualitative or quantitative marketing research activities performed by The Brand Surgeon, and only in accordance with the specific incentive offer disclosed for each activity.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is dedicated to providing quality data to our clients. To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">Redeeming REWARDS You can see your REWARDS at any time by going to the Rewards tab on the main page. REWARDS are awarded for qualifying and quality Survey completion, Profile completion, and other participation on this Site. REWARDS automatically convert to cash values whenever you request a payment but only when there are 500 reward points available (10 rewards = R1).<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">Rewards will be allocated within 5 working days of the completion of a project. Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">Removal of Rewards All rewards are subject to change as may be necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations and we reserve the right to void vouchers or rewards where such laws or regulations dictate that we must do so, or where we can show fraud or lack of quality or time spent completing a survey or research task.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is a South African based research company who do qualitative and quantitative market research online research panel where consumers give our clients&#8217; feedback in exchange for a reward. We deliver high-quality market research data to clients who are in various business industries, including other market research agencies.

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">Your constitutional right to privacy (which requires your personal information to be protected): and<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud).

Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

We deliver high-quality market research data to clients who are in various business industries, including other market research agencies.

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">Your constitutional right to privacy (which requires your personal information to be protected): and<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33591 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\r\\n</span></span>

REWARDS are redeemable for cash, vouchers and other prizes.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Earning REWARDS REWARDS will be credited to your account only through your participation in activities authorised by The Brand Surgeon, which include, but are not limited to, registration as a panellist, completion of demographic profiles and completion of qualitative or quantitative marketing research activities performed by The Brand Surgeon, and only in accordance with the specific incentive offer disclosed for each activity.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is dedicated to providing quality data to our clients. To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Redeeming REWARDS You can see your REWARDS at any time by going to the Rewards tab on the main page. REWARDS are awarded for qualifying and quality Survey completion, Profile completion, and other participation on this Site. REWARDS automatically convert to cash values whenever you request a payment but only when there are 500 reward points available (10 rewards = R1).<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Rewards will be allocated within 5 working days of the completion of a project. Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Removal of Rewards All rewards are subject to change as may be necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations and we reserve the right to void vouchers or rewards where such laws or regulations dictate that we must do so, or where we can show fraud or lack of quality or time spent completing a survey or research task.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is a South African based research company who do qualitative and quantitative market research online research panel where consumers give our clients&#8217; feedback in exchange for a reward. We deliver high-quality market research data to clients who are in various business industries, including other market research agencies. We maintain online and face to face consumer panels and research surveys, providing real-time digital consumer insights to our clients via our market research surveys and analytics platforms.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is a company with whom you register as a member, and we are responsible for your personal data.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Your constitutional right to privacy (which requires your personal information to be protected): and<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The needs of our company to have access to and to use your personal information for legitimate research purposes, for example, to enable us to do our work for you.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI obliges us to inform you of our process.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is a South African based research company who do qualitative and quantitative market research online research panel where consumers give our clients&#8217; feedback in exchange for a reward. We deliver high-quality market research data to clients who are in various business industries, including other market research agencies. We maintain online and face to face consumer panels and research surveys, providing real-time digital consumer insights to our clients via our market research surveys and analytics platforms.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is a company with whom you register as a member, and we are responsible for your personal data.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Your constitutional right to privacy (which requires your personal information to be protected): and<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The needs of our company to have access to and to use your personal information for legitimate research purposes, for example, to enable us to do our work for you.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI obliges us to inform you of our process.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Earning REWARDS REWARDS will be credited to your account only through your participation in activities authorised by The Brand Surgeon, which include, but are not limited to, registration as a panellist, completion of demographic profiles and completion of qualitative or quantitative marketing research activities performed by The Brand Surgeon, and only in accordance with the specific incentive offer disclosed for each activity.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is dedicated to providing quality data to our clients. To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Redeeming REWARDS You can see your REWARDS at any time by going to the Rewards tab on the main page. REWARDS are awarded for qualifying and quality Survey completion, Profile completion, and other participation on this Site. REWARDS automatically convert to cash values whenever you request a payment but only when there are 500 reward points available (10 rewards = R1).<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Rewards will be allocated within 5 working days of the completion of a project. Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is a South African based research company who do qualitative and quantitative market research online research panel where consumers give our clients&#8217; feedback in exchange for a reward. We deliver high-quality market research data to clients who are in various business industries, including other market research agencies. We maintain online and face to face consumer panels and research surveys, providing real-time digital consumer insights to our clients via our market research surveys and analytics platforms.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is a company with whom you register as a member, and we are responsible for your personal data.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Your constitutional right to privacy (which requires your personal information to be protected): and<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The needs of our company to have access to and to use your personal information for legitimate research purposes, for example, to enable us to do our work for you.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI obliges us to inform you of our process.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is a South African based research company who do qualitative and quantitative market research online research panel where consumers give our clients&#8217; feedback in exchange for a reward. We deliver high-quality market research data to clients who are in various business industries, including other market research agencies. We maintain online and face to face consumer panels and research surveys, providing real-time digital consumer insights to our clients via our market research surveys and analytics platforms.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is a company with whom you register as a member, and we are responsible for your personal data.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Your constitutional right to privacy (which requires your personal information to be protected): and<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The needs of our company to have access to and to use your personal information for legitimate research purposes, for example, to enable us to do our work for you.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI obliges us to inform you of our process.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

We deliver high-quality market research data to clients who are in various business industries, including other market research agencies.

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is a company with whom you register as a member, and we are responsible for your personal data.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">REWARDS OVERVIEW What are REWARDS? The Brand Surgeon values our member&#8217;s feedback and participation, and to show our appreciation and in recognition of this, The Brand Surgeon offers incentives in the form of credits, which are called REWARDS. These are added to your account by The Brand Surgeon only for SUCCESSFUL completion of feedback surveys, telephone calls, videos, online groups, in home visits, mystery shopping or any other form of research feedback. REWARDS are redeemable for cash, vouchers and other prizes.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Earning REWARDS REWARDS will be credited to your account only through your participation in activities authorised by The Brand Surgeon, which include, but are not limited to, registration as a panellist, completion of demographic profiles and completion of qualitative or quantitative marketing research activities performed by The Brand Surgeon, and only in accordance with the specific incentive offer disclosed for each activity.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is dedicated to providing quality data to our clients. To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Redeeming REWARDS You can see your REWARDS at any time by going to the Rewards tab on the main page. REWARDS are awarded for qualifying and quality Survey completion, Profile completion, and other participation on this Site. REWARDS automatically convert to cash values whenever you request a payment but only when there are 500 reward points available (10 rewards = R1).<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Rewards will be allocated within 5 working days of the completion of a project. Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Your constitutional right to privacy (which requires your personal information to be protected): and<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The needs of our company to have access to and to use your personal information for legitimate research purposes, for example, to enable us to do our work for you.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI obliges us to inform you of our process.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

The Brand Surgeon values our member&#8217;s feedback and participation, and to show our appreciation and in recognition of this, The Brand Surgeon offers incentives in the form of credits, which are called REWARDS. These are added to your account by The Brand Surgeon only for SUCCESSFUL completion of feedback surveys, telephone calls, videos, online groups, in home visits, mystery shopping or any other form of research feedback. REWARDS are redeemable for cash, vouchers and other prizes.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Earning REWARDS REWARDS will be credited to your account only through your participation in activities authorised by The Brand Surgeon, which include, but are not limited to, registration as a panellist, completion of demographic profiles and completion of qualitative or quantitative marketing research activities performed by The Brand Surgeon, and only in accordance with the specific incentive offer disclosed for each activity.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is dedicated to providing quality data to our clients. To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Redeeming REWARDS You can see your REWARDS at any time by going to the Rewards tab on the main page. REWARDS are awarded for qualifying and quality Survey completion, Profile completion, and other participation on this Site. REWARDS automatically convert to cash values whenever you request a payment but only when there are 500 reward points available (10 rewards = R1).<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Your constitutional right to privacy (which requires your personal information to be protected): and<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The needs of our company to have access to and to use your personal information for legitimate research purposes, for example, to enable us to do our work for you.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI obliges us to inform you of our process.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

The Brand Surgeon values our member&#8217;s feedback and participation, and to show our appreciation and in recognition of this, The Brand Surgeon offers incentives in the form of credits, which are called REWARDS. These are added to your account by The Brand Surgeon only for SUCCESSFUL completion of feedback surveys, telephone calls, videos, online groups, in home visits, mystery shopping or any other form of research feedback. REWARDS are redeemable for cash, vouchers and other prizes.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Earning REWARDS REWARDS will be credited to your account only through your participation in activities authorised by The Brand Surgeon, which include, but are not limited to, registration as a panellist, completion of demographic profiles and completion of qualitative or quantitative marketing research activities performed by The Brand Surgeon, and only in accordance with the specific incentive offer disclosed for each activity.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is dedicated to providing quality data to our clients. To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Redeeming REWARDS You can see your REWARDS at any time by going to the Rewards tab on the main page. REWARDS are awarded for qualifying and quality Survey completion, Profile completion, and other participation on this Site. REWARDS automatically convert to cash values whenever you request a payment but only when there are 500 reward points available (10 rewards = R1).<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Your constitutional right to privacy (which requires your personal information to be protected): and<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The needs of our company to have access to and to use your personal information for legitimate research purposes, for example, to enable us to do our work for you.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI obliges us to inform you of our process.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

The Brand Surgeon values our member&#8217;s feedback and participation, and to show our appreciation and in recognition of this, The Brand Surgeon offers incentives in the form of credits, which are called REWARDS. These are added to your account by The Brand Surgeon only for SUCCESSFUL completion of feedback surveys, telephone calls, videos, online groups, in home visits, mystery shopping or any other form of research feedback. REWARDS are redeemable for cash, vouchers and other prizes.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Earning REWARDS REWARDS will be credited to your account only through your participation in activities authorised by The Brand Surgeon, which include, but are not limited to, registration as a panellist, completion of demographic profiles and completion of qualitative or quantitative marketing research activities performed by The Brand Surgeon, and only in accordance with the specific incentive offer disclosed for each activity.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Brand Surgeon is dedicated to providing quality data to our clients. To ensure this level of quality, please note that you might not qualify for all Surveys, in which case, the Survey will close. The reasons you might not qualify include, but are not limited to: Your profile not corresponding to our client&#8217;s target demographic. Inconsistencies of responses (rushed, back check questions not lining up etc.). Dishonest responses or false answers. Attempts to duplicate the surveys in order to get paid twice (fraud). Harmful or abusive replies. Any other attempted fraud like one person doing multiple surveys on different devices etc.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Redeeming REWARDS You can see your REWARDS at any time by going to the Rewards tab on the main page. REWARDS are awarded for qualifying and quality Survey completion, Profile completion, and other participation on this Site. REWARDS automatically convert to cash values whenever you request a payment but only when there are 500 reward points available (10 rewards = R1).<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

Note that we sometimes have to wait a few days for clients to verify the quality of the survey information. However, if we allocate REWARDS to a participant and the client comes back and tells us that there is a quality issue with a survey, we reserve the right to remove those rewards from a profile, as your feedback then becomes redundant and cannot be used.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>

      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPI?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act (No. 4 of 2013) is a governmental regulation designed to protect the personal information of South African citizens, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. If we are collecting personal information of SA citizens (for instance, through interviews or focus groups, or surveys that collect identifiers such as names, contact information, etc.), The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) regulates how we handle your personal information while we do our work as a market research consultancy.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI stands for Protection of Personal Information.  Regardless of whether there is a law or not, The Brand Surgeon needs to ensure that the Personal Information we capture, manage and store, is secure.  It makes common, logical sense that this information is sensitive, and shouldn&#039;t be exposed.  One of the principles that we all should consider is &quot;privacy by design&quot;.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">This means that we consider privacy implications in all our processes and systems and build security and privacy concepts into the day-to-day operation within the Brand Surgeon. POPI is all about Privacy, and this means security.  In order to secure information, we have systems and structures in place to understand what information is gathered and how it is kept.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The core focus of POPI in a research context is ensuring that if personal identifiers must be collected, they need to be stored in a secure, access-controlled location to prevent the data being harvested and used by third parties. POPI does not prevent open data sharing - in fact, open data sharing, by virtue of the need to remove personal identifiers from shared datasets, complies entirely with POPI. In research, POPI impacts more on research process, such as being strategic in storing only de-identified datasets on cloud storage, and ensuring that on-site storage (personal hard drives, external hard drives, the UCT G Drive) is strictly access-controlled to named and designated individuals to ensure data protection.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI is intended to balance 2 competing interests, these are:<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">Your constitutional right to privacy (which requires your personal information to be protected): and<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The needs of our company to have access to and to use your personal information for legitimate research purposes, for example, to enable us to do our work for you.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPI obliges us to inform you of our process.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\"><span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">What is POPIA?<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act.  This is the new law and is something that most (if not all organisations, including The Brand Surgeon) will need to follow.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
      <span class=sf-dump-str title=\"33394 characters\">The difference between POPI and POPIA is that POPI is the act of protecting Personal Information.  This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the Brand Surgeon relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI.  In order to comply with POPIA, we needed to implement a POPI programme.  In order to implement it, there were a number of steps which need to be followed and a number of documents and instruments which were developed.<span class=\"sf-dump-default sf-dump-ns\">\\n</span></span>
